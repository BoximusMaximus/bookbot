# bookbot

This ended up being a huge waste of time to be honest. I love Boot.dev but through this, ive learned Python is a pretty gross language and I would rather focus on GO, C++, C#, or something else. 

The course also expected different results from the book I copied into my project. I couldnt figure out why my copy was different and I realized that this entire project is only covering the bare minumum steps anyways. I may tackle this again but If I do, I think C# or GO is going to be the new language.
